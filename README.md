# Image_processing

Here, I will implement algorithms learned from the lecture "Mathematical Image Processing"

#### Note: This section of the code uses a ‘for loop’ structure instead of numpy operations. While numpy could make the code more efficient, the ‘for loop’ approach is used here to make the underlying algorithm easier to understand.
